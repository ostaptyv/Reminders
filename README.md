# Test projects

There's some special commit messages style provided.

I will follow the "atomic commits" style of commiting as it helps easily reset current project state to the stable one in case of some critical bug or change in the project. As this repository may contain more than one projects in it, each commit will go with [PROJECT-NAME] mark in the beggining of the header of the commit message. After it messages will not differ from other commit messages you've seen before.

Also between these commit messages I will commit and post messages that will indicate the end of the day as my mentors' asked me to do so. It may contain some uncompleted features and will look something like this:

----------------------- DAY N ENDED (02.01.2019) -----------------------

Completed N day summary includes all the atomic commits made between the N and N-1 days:

----------------------- DAY N ENDED (02.01.2019) ----------------------- ]
                                                                         ]
[PROJECT-NAME1] Atomic commit 2                                          ]  this is the summary of the N day
                                                                         ]
[PROJECT-NAME1] Atomic commit 1					                   		 ]
                                                                         ]
---------------------- DAY N-1 ENDED (01.01.2019) ----------------------
